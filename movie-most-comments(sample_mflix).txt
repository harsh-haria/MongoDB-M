In db sample_mflix, collections movies and comments, 
find the name/title of the movie having the most comments 

db.movies.aggregate([
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: "comments",
            localField: "_id",
            foreignField: "movie_id",
            as: "comments"
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {
            title: 1,
            commentCount: { $size: "$comments" }
        }
    },
    {
        $match: { "commentCount": { $gt:0 } }
    },
    {
        $sort: { commentCount: -1 }
    },
    {
        $limit: 1
    }
])

#match of 'commentCount' is optional, but i think it will be faster if we do it before sort
